General EHS Guidelines
Industry-Sector EHS Guidelines
The World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Guidelines are technical reference documents of
Good International Industry Practice
(GIIP). They are comprised of the General EHS Guidelines and Industry-Sector EHS Guidelines. When one or more members of the World Bank Group are involved in a project, the EHS Guidelines are applied as described in their respective policies and standards.
The EHS Guidelines specify the performance levels and measures that are generally considered to be good GIIP and achievable in new facilities by using existing technology at reasonable costs.
The applicability of the EHS Guidelines should be tailored to the hazards and risks identified for each project based on the results of an environmental assessment that considers site-specific variables, such as host country context, assimilative capacity of the environment, and other project-specific factors. The applicability of specific technical recommendations should follow GIIP and be based on the professional opinion of qualified experts.
The World Bank Group is
currently updating the EHS Guidelines
to reflect the most current GIIP.
General EHS Guidelines
The General EHS Guidelines present information on common environmental, health, and safety (EHS) issues that potentially apply to and are relevant across industry sectors.  This document should be used together with the relevant
Industry-Sector EHS Guidelines
.
